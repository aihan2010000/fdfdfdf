Africa boasts the greatest variety of animals and includes animals such as lions elephants, cheetahs, deer, giraffes, camels, monkeys etc. One ecological problem is deforestation where forests are being destroyed to make room   for the growing pf corps. This is destroying the habitat for many of the endangered species.

The climate in Africa varies from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks. In the northern part of Africa there are deserts and most of the land is arid. In the central and southern parts there are savannah plains and dense rainforests.
 

Most scientists regard the African continent to be the origin of the human species and evidence has been found of the first modern Human called Homo sapiens dating around 200000 years old.
